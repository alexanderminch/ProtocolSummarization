# Clinical Trial Protocol Document Summarizer

---

## Deliverable

Create a program to summarize CL Protocol docs (DOCX, PDF, or Plain Text) into 8 categories:
- Study Objectives
- Study Endpoints
- Study Design
- Study Population
- Study Treatments 
- Study Procedures
- Study Monitoring
- Study Methods

For each topic, it compiles all information scattered throughout the report into one of the classifications. Then, using a LLM, summarizes and consolidates the amalgamation of texts into a concise and complete summary.
